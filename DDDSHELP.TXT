Purpose of data sets:

    The data sets contain text identical to the DeltaUSA hardcopy
    reports generated by the Deltanet maintained Easytrive members.
    The data sets are created using these same members.  There is one
    Easytrive for each Deltanet claims processing region.

        WTHHAL05 for the Alabama region
