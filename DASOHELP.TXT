Purpose of list:

    Admin for DeltaUSA service fees is reported separately for
    ASO and Risk groups.  The system will search the ASO List in
    order to calculate service fees by group type (ASO or Risk).

Instructions:

1.  Select 'Maintain ASO Group List' option from the Main Menu.

2.  To add a group, select 'Add New Group' from the ASO List Menu.
    To delete a group, select 'Delete Group' from the menu.

3.  The system will prompt you to enter a group number.  The
    group number must be in the format xx-0yyyy or it will be
    rejected.  'xx' is the two letter state abbreviation for a
    DDIC state and 'yyyy' is the four digit group record number.
    Sublocations do not need to be entered.

4.  Verify that the system confirmed the addition or deletion
    of the group.  You can print a report listing all ASO groups
    in the system, in group number order, from the Report Menu.
