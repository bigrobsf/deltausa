Results of processing:

    The system reads the state, group number, number and amount of
    claims processed, service fees, and withhold amounts from the
    downloaded data sets.  The system separates this data based on
    state.  Non-DDIC state data is written to PAY_USA.txt.  DDIC
    data is written to DDIC_USA.txt.  Although DDIC_USA.txt is not
    used for later processing, its totals can be added to PAY_USA.txt
    to tie to the DeltaUSA reports.  PAY_USA.txt contains fees and
    withhold amounts which must be remitted to other Delta plans.

    The system then summarizes the data in PAY_USA.txt by processing
    region and state to PAY_SUMM.txt.  The summarized file can be
    imported into a spreadsheet referenced by another spreadsheet
    file to automatically populate remittance advices.

    Based on the groups listed in the ASO_LIST.txt file, the system
    separates the data in the PAY_USA.txt file into RISK_USA.txt and
    ASO_USA.txt.  The resulting report can be used to calculate admin.

Instructions:

1.  Select 'Process Mainframe Files' from the Main Menu.

2.  Enter the beginning check date.  This is the same date
    used to run the Easytreive data set creation jobs.  Dates
    must be entered in format mm/dd/yyyy.

3.  Enter the ending check date.  This is the same date
    used to run the Easytreive data set creation jobs.  Dates
    must be entered in format mm/dd/yyyy.

4.  The system will verify the user entered dates against the
    downloaded data files.  If both dates do not match the 
    dates in all seven data files, the system will not process
    the data.

5.  If the dates do not match, check the dates on line 17 of
    each of the Easytrieve jobs.  Re-run and download as needed.
